I created this page in order to share and synthesize 2048 variants that I find either odd, fun, interesting, or that I just felt was good
to know, regardless if it may ever be useful to anyone.

The main idea is for people who like to play 2048 games.

Obviously the various post cover a wide variety of topics, and I'm by no mean an
expert in 2048 things, in case there are mistakes, feel free let a comment, I'll
be glad to correct and make things more accurate! :)

Note: This page is only used for 2048 variants.
